## Professional Experience

### VP, DevOps Engineering Manager — Citizens Bank  
Johnston, RI | 2019 – 2025

Led enterprise cloud adoption and large-scale application migration programs across the bank, combining technical leadership, architecture governance, and hands-on delivery.

- Acted as enterprise architect for migration initiatives: defined and owned application migration roadmaps for portfolios of 60+ on‑prem applications, specifying rehost/replatform/refactor/replace/retire strategies aligned to business priorities.  
- Directed discovery, assessment, and dependency mapping efforts across application landscapes to produce migration waves and runbooks used by delivery teams.  
- Architected target AWS and hybrid architectures (multi-AZ/Region) that delivered scalability, resilience, security, and cost controls; selected services (EC2, RDS, DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, ECS/EKS) to meet workload requirements.  
- Drove IaC and automation standards using Terraform Enterprise and Ansible; authored core Terraform modules (ALB, EC2, S3, RDS, ASG, FSx) and published them to an internal module registry to ensure repeatable, compliant deployments.  
- Implemented CI/CD pipelines and AMI build automation to accelerate migrations and maintain immutable infrastructure best practices.  
- Partnered with application teams and business owners to refactor critical workloads into containerized microservices where appropriate, enabling EKS/ECS migration patterns and improved deployment velocity.  
- Implemented discovery-to-runbook automation and Python/CLI provisioners for RAG/AI frameworks, reducing manual provisioning and speeding environment creation.  
- Led performance and monitoring strategy: established baselines pre/post migration (CloudWatch, logs, custom metrics), validated SLAs, and tuned architectures for latency and throughput.  
- Drove FinOps initiatives: engineered EC2/RDS hibernation and auto-shutdown automation that reduced infrastructure spend by $217K/month; collaborated with finance to align migration costs and ongoing run costs with business expectations.  
- Ensured security, compliance, and governance alignment for migrated applications through IAM standards, encryption (KMS), secrets management, and coordinated reviews with security teams.  
- Chaired Architecture Review Board sessions for migration program proposals; facilitated cross-domain architectural reviews, documented ARB outcomes, and ensured traceability to enterprise strategy and controls.  
- Mentored cloud engineers and solution architects on migration best practices, IaC, containerization, and cloud-native design principles.  
- Managed vendor/third-party relationships and provided technical direction to contractors and external partners.

### Director, DevOps & Software Engineering — Purch (Business.com, Buyerzone.com)  
Waltham, MA | 2015 – 2019

Led AWS migrations, cloud architecture, cost optimization and platform reliability for consumer-facing SaaS properties.

- Owned full AWS infrastructure migration for multiple properties including account/VPC design, cross-account migration, and RDS migrations; executed rehost and replatform strategies for 20+ servers and DB instances.  
- Designed and implemented cost-optimized patterns (instance right-sizing, auto-shutdowns, Reserved Instance planning) reducing AWS spend from $32K to $17K/month.  
- Built CI/CD pipelines and automation for environment lifecycle management and deployment orchestration; implemented real-time operational dashboards for performance and cost visibility.  
- Introduced microservices and API-driven architectures to replace legacy monolith components, enabling container orchestration on ECS and improved fault isolation.  
- Collaborated with product and business stakeholders to prioritize migration waves, align architecture trade-offs with business value, and document runbooks and migration playbooks.  
- Mentored engineers on cloud-native design, security hardening, TLS/PKI upgrades, and operational readiness checklists.

### Lead Software Engineer — Road Scholar  
Boston, MA | 2012 – 2014

Delivered API and platform modernization while integrating multiple enterprise data sources and environments.

- Architected and delivered RESTful APIs and multi-environment deployment patterns, supporting Oracle, SQL Server and MongoDB backends.  
- Automated deployments and environment provisioning tools (TFS-integrated deployment tool, Python services) to reduce release friction and enforce consistency across dev/qa/prod.  
- Collaborated closely with Enterprise Architecture to align application architecture and dependency mappings with longer-term EA strategy.

### Senior Software Engineer — CBS (cnet.com, zdnet.com, techrepublic.com)  
Boston, MA | 2011 – 2013

Built and optimized high-volume web services and deployment automation frameworks to support millions of daily requests.

- Designed and deployed scalable Java and .NET services in a high throughput environment; implemented deployment automation, monitoring, and log aggregation.  
- Implemented unit testing frameworks and CI practices that improved release reliability and reduced rollbacks.

### Senior Software Engineer — Retail Decisions  
Providence, RI | 2007 – 2011

Delivered enterprise-grade fraud detection systems, large-scale data migrations, and client-facing installations across global accounts.

- Led 12+ production system migrations with rollback strategies, ANT builds, and Tomcat deployments; executed large data loads and schema porting between Oracle and SQL Server.  
- Performed application modernization tasks, performance tuning, and delivered production-level automation for client onboarding.
